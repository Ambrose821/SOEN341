<h2>Objective</h2>
Develop a car rental web application.
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>When traveling, it is common for people to rent a vehicle for a short period of time. In this project, our aim is to craft a user-friendly car rental application. Without the need for immediate login, users can browse available vehicles across diverse locations for their desired duration. Creating an account enhances their experience, enabling them to reserve, view, modify, and cancel bookings. Additionally, they can curate a list of favorite vehicles.</p>
