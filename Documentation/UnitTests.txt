Unit Testing in JavaScript with Jest
Overview
This documentation provides an introduction to unit testing in JavaScript using Jest. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works out of the box for most JavaScript projects, providing an integrated experience for testing your codebase.

Key Features of Jest
Zero Configuration: Jest is designed to work out of the box, with minimal setup required.
Snapshot Testing: Capture snapshots of large objects to simplify test writing and improve readability.
Mock Functions: Easily mock functions, allowing you to isolate the unit of code under test.
Coverage Reports: Automatically generate coverage reports by adding a single command line option.
Setting Up Jest
Installation
Jest can be installed using npm or Yarn. To get started, run one of the following commands in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev jest
or

bash
Copy code
yarn add --dev jest
Configuring Jest
For most projects, Jest works out of the box. However, for more fine-grained control, you can configure Jest by adding a jest.config.js file or a jest field in your package.json.

Example package.json configuration:

json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "jest": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
Writing Tests
A basic test in Jest consists of a describe block that groups together similar tests and an it or test function that defines an individual test case.

Example test for a simple function sum.js:

javascript
Copy code
// sum.js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = sum;
Test file sum.test.js:

javascript
Copy code
const sum = require('./sum');

describe('sum function', () => {
  it('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
});
Running Tests
To run your tests, add the following script to your package.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
Then, execute the tests by running:

bash
Copy code
npm test
or

bash
Copy code
yarn test
Advanced Features
Mocking
Jest provides a powerful mocking system that allows you to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and functions.

Example of mocking a module:

javascript
Copy code
jest.mock('./moduleToMock');
const moduleToMock = require('./moduleToMock');

// Configure the mock to return a specific value
moduleToMock.mockImplementation(() => 42);

// Use the mock in tests
Coverage
To generate a coverage report, add the --coverage flag to the test script in your package.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
