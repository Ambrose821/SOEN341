Documentation: UseNav Hook
Overview
The UseNav hook is designed to simplify navigation and routing in single-page applications (SPAs). It provides developers with a straightforward way to manage navigation state, initiate navigation actions, and handle query parameters or paths programmatically.

Features
Navigation State Management: Easily access and respond to the current navigation state within your application.
Programmatic Navigation: Initiate navigation to different routes programmatically without requiring user interaction with link elements.
Dynamic Parameter Handling: Manipulate URL parameters and query strings directly from your application logic, enabling dynamic route generation.
Use Cases
Redirecting users based on application state (e.g., after login).
Building breadcrumb components that reflect the navigation history.
Manipulating query strings for filtered views in applications like e-commerce sites or search pages.
Setup and Initialization
Installation
Assuming UseNav is a custom hook, ensure it's included in your project directly or via a supporting library. For a custom implementation, import it from its definition file:

javascript
Copy code
import useNav from './hooks/useNav'; // Adjust the path based on your project structure
Basic Usage
Import the Hook:

Incorporate UseNav into your component:

jsx
Copy code
import useNav from 'path/to/useNav';
Access Navigation Functions:

Within your component, invoke useNav to access its functionalities:

jsx
Copy code
const { navigate, currentPath, setQueryParams } = useNav();
API Reference
navigate(path: string)
Navigates to the specified path programmatically.

Parameters:
path: The path to navigate to, relative to the application's base URL.
Returns: None.
currentPath()
Returns the current path of the application.

Parameters: None.
Returns: A string representing the current path.
setQueryParams(params: object)
Updates the current URL's query parameters.

Parameters:
params: An object where keys are parameter names and values are the corresponding parameter values.
Returns: None.
Examples
Navigating to a New Page
jsx
Copy code
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { navigate } = useNav();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => navigate('/about')}>
      Go to About Page
    </button>
  );
};
Setting Query Parameters
jsx
Copy code
const FilterComponent = () => {
  const { setQueryParams } = useNav();

  const applyFilters = (filters) => {
    setQueryParams(filters);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={() => applyFilters({ color: 'red', size: 'M' })}>
      Apply Filters
    </button>
  );
};
Best Practices
Encapsulation: Use UseNav within components that are directly involved with navigation or need to react to navigation changes.
Side Effects: Avoid triggering navigati
