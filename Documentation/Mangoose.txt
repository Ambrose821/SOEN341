Mongoose is a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks, and more, out of the box. Hereâ€™s an overview of how Mongoose works and its key concepts:

Key Concepts
Schemas
A schema is a way to define the structure of the data that will be stored in a MongoDB document. It specifies the types of data, the validations it should undergo, and the default values. Schemas are used to create models.

javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: String, // `name` is a String
  age: Number, // `age` is a Number
  email: { type: String, required: true }, // `email` is a required String
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }, // Default values can be specified
});
Models
A model is a compiled version of the schema. A Mongoose model provides an interface to the database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records, etc.

javascript
Copy code
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Connections
Mongoose allows you to connect to your MongoDB database using its connect method. This is usually one of the first steps you take when starting your application.

javascript
Copy code
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/myapp', {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true});
Operations
With models, you can perform various operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents (CRUD).

Create:

javascript
Copy code
const newUser = new User({ name: 'John Doe', age: 30, email: 'johndoe@example.com' });
newUser.save().then(doc => console.log(doc));
Read:

javascript
Copy code
User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }, (err, docs) => {
  // docs with age 18 and above
});
Update:

javascript
Copy code
User.updateOne({ _id: id }, { $set: { name: 'Jane Doe' } }).then(result => console.log(result));
